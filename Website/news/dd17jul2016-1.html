			<p>Hey everyone!<br>
			It's finally time to announce the new captain and vice-captain of BITSFC for the 16-17 season.<br>
			Captain of BITSFC : Parth Madan<br>
			Vice-captain of BITSFC : Amol Saket<br>
			My heartiest congratulations to both of them. You guys deserve it.<br>
			<br>
			Parth has been a great player for BITSFC throughout. Ever since he joined the team in his first year, his passion for football and our team has been evident. I remember so many instances last year where he communicated with the team much better than I could. I also remember one conversation I had with both Amol and Parth in Mumbai during KJ Somaiya. The level of maturity shown by both of them was simply unbelievable. I have always maintained the fact that leading a football team like BITSFC for a year is like completing a mini MBA. It's not just about the football. It's about man-management; dealing with atleast 20 different personalities, about keeping the team motivated (which I found was the most enjoyable part) and communicating with people from the administration all while thinking about what tactics can work best against which opposition. These two had full knowledge of all of this and more which was wonderful!<br>
			<br>
			Amol Saket is hands down, the best athlete of our team. With regards to his ball skills, I remember one moment in my second year when Umer sir chose a random boy (who happened to be Amol) from the team and told him to juggle the ball. He would have kept juggling all night had sir not asked him to stop! Even Umer sir was awestruck! Amol's discipline and hard work is something which anyone can get inspired from. I have no doubt that he will rise up to this responsibility.<br>
			<br>
			Suhas Pai has been a great keeper for us throughout last year. Even after suffering a deep gash on his eyebrow (which made him look pretty pirate-ish due to the absence of hair and some stitches on one eyebrow) in one of our matches, he recovered and was in full training within a week. That proved his quality as a person and not just a keeper. He'll be an essential part of the leadership for next year.<br>
			<br>
			Our new inductees last year; Nishant Ravindra, Shubham Shastri and Kalyan Kumar Datta have been pushing harder every single day in training. I do hope Anand Dev also recovers from injury and cements his place in the team. They will have some big roles to fill next season and I'm sure they will, with their dedication and commitment.<br>
			<br>
			This post cannot be complete without mentioning our exceptional first yearites. I can't put into words how excited I am to watch them grow as footballers and personalities. Aravind Venugopal, Gurdain Singh Madan, Rinal Praveen and Ameya Shah you guys have amazed me throughout. Because of them our existing players had to put in extra hours after training to keep their place in the team. Their skill on the ball and courage and intelligence on the field is something players get after several years of experience. Keep your head down and work hard guys because you have the potential to become some of the best players our team has ever had.<br>
			<br>
			I would like to thank our captain Rohit Banerjee. He got the team's spirits up again and has built a great foundation for the years to come. Also, a huge thanks to the rest of the teammates from my batch. You guys were top professionals and working with you guys everyday was an absolute joy.<br>
			<br>
			Our senior players served as a constant inspiration throughout the year. There is so much we all learned from them footballing and also otherwise. I'm sorry it was a disappointment in the end but I bet the new boys will do just fine!<br>
			<br>
			Lastly, I would like to thank Chandu Lamani sir without whom none of this would have been possible. His help and support is what kept us going and will continue to drive us ahead in the future. Thanks a lot for the guidance sir.<br>
			<br>
			BITSFC<br>
			A loud one this time, ONE TEAM!</p>
