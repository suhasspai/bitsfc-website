			<p>During my entire stay as part of the team, I've seen BITS FC endure the toughest of times. This is especially true with regard to the Goa league, which is the hallmark competition that allows us to be called a professional club in every regard. From having to play the 2nd division Goa league during Compre with squad availability issues in my first year to having to see the entire squad go through the disappointment of missing out entirely from participating in the Goa league after putting in a lot of effort into what was probably the most grueling pre-season of recent times. I still vividly remember the day when after training Banerjee sat us down and told us that GFA had decided to disallow our participation in the 3rd division; you could almost but hear everyone's heart break. We went from dreams of promotion to dismay and disbelief at what had happened, but the team got themselves back up and trained hard as ever till the last day of the semester. Also over the last year, we were undone by two penalty shoot-outs, one in the Herald tournament in a game we deserved to win against PCCE and a Spree semi-finals against SVC, after a performance that any member of the team would have been a extremely proud of. So it wouldn't be wrong to say that the team has been through some turbulent times. Over the years I've lived off old posts and anecdotes from seniors about the legacy of this club, and instances that still give me goose bumps even though I was never there to witness them. So when we were handed over the honor of carrying forward this legacy, there were certain things that needed to be set right and the most important was the Goa league situation.<br>
			<br>
			So I've got good news on the way for everyone. After a lot of discussion and deliberation over the past month, and the unwavering efforts of Chandu Lamani Sir, I can now confirm that BITS FC has renewed its status as a provisional member of the GFA, and will be participating in the Goa League 3rd division next season. After what happened last year, it was extremely important to get us back in the league and continue what had been started by our seniors after a lot of effort. Hence, we got on it straightaway and are extremely glad that to see the permission go through.<br>
			<br>
			To be honest we know the real work starts when we get back to on campus and start training. However, after all of what has happened to us over the past two years, it may well be said that we can start to put tough times behind us. We are fully aware of the challenge that lay ahead of us, especially taking into account that the Goa league will be a new experience for a lot of the squad including myself given the one year absence. But we want to take it in our stride and get to working on our goal as early as possible, and we will settle at nothing but taking the club to the place it so rightfully belongs.<br>
			<br>
			One Team!</p>
