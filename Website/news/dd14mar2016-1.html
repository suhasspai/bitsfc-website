			<p>Hello everyone,<br>
			We had played our semifinal against SVC on 6th March. Final score 0-0 draw. (6)2-3(6) on penalties. It was heartbreaking to go out on penalties again. We had controlled the game well and created a few chances too but were not clinical. In the first half there were some spells where we had to keep shape and defensive discipline, but apart from that we kept possession well. We still lacked penetration, credit to their defending. Their keeper also kept brilliantly to keep out some shots and penalties. SVC went on to play Motilal in the finals and SVC won on penalties after a 0-0 draw. Judging by the game we played, I can confidently say that we weren't far away.<br>
			Even though this year wasn't successful, I can be sure that in the next 2 years, with the kind of players we have, we have a great chance of winning spree and the Goa league. We will be pushing for Goa league participation for next semester right from now. Also, to carry on the momentum, we will be playing a few friendlies where we will be fielding our future squad. It would be great if we can give them match experience and at the same time correct their mistakes now. Ideally, we would want to come next semester, get our fitness levels up and straight away start playing friendlies and tournaments as the system and playing style would already be set. This would really make us a much more solid team. So even though technically, our last tournament is over, there is still a lot of work which needs to be done to ensure that we reach new heights in the coming years.<br>
			I would like to thank Chandu Lamani sir for all the help throughout the year. Without his help, none of this would have been possible. I would also like to thank all our fans for the wonderful support. It was a joy playing for such passionate fans. I would urge you all to support our team in the coming years in spree as well as the Goa league.<br>
			I will keep updating the page to inform you all about the friendlies as and when they are scheduled.<br>
			BITSFC<br>
			One team!</p>
